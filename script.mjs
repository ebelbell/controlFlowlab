/** This program advises a group of environmental scientists how to handle the growth 
and spread of a unique plant species under their supervision. Develop a growth 
control system that will monitor and predict the plant growth, based 
on the available space and potential growth.

Plant Info: plant containers are circular w/ a 5m radius.
Calculate the area formula: 
const PI = 3.1415;
const area = PI * radius * radius;

Other info: Each plant requires a minimum space of 0.8 square meters.
The area is starting with 20 plants.
The plants double in number every week.
